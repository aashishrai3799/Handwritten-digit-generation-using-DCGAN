# Handwritten-digit-generation-using-DCGAN
Generating handwritten digits using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN).

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a class of machine learning systems invented by Ian Goodfellow[1] in 2014. 
Two neural networks contest with each other in a game (in the sense of game theory, often but not always in the form 
of a zero-sum game). Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the 
training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially 
authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics.
